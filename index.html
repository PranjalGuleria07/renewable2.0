    <h1><i>What is Renewable Energy?</i></h1>
    <p>Renewable energy, often referred to as clean energy, comes from natural sources or processes that are constantly replenished. For example, sunlight and wind keep shining and blowing, even if their availability depends on time and weather.

      While renewable energy is often thought of as a new technology, harnessing nature’s power has long been used for heating, transportation, lighting, and more. Wind has powered boats to sail the seas and windmills to grind grain. The sun has provided warmth during the day and helped kindle fires to last into the evening. But over the past 500 years or so, humans increasingly turned to cheaper, dirtier energy sources, such as coal and fracked gas.
      
      Now that we have innovative and less-expensive ways to capture and retain wind and solar energy, renewables are becoming a more important power source, accounting for more than 12 percent of U.S. energy generation. The expansion in renewables is also happening at scales large and small, from giant offshore wind farms to rooftop solar panels on homes, which can sell power back to the grid. Even entire rural communities (in Alaska, Kansas, and Missouri) are relying on renewable energy for heating and lighting.
      
      As renewable use continues to grow, a key goal will be to modernize America’s electricity grid, making it smarter, more secure, and better integrated across regions.</p>

    <h1><i>Solar Energy</i></h1>  
    <img src="https://eco-greenenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/83.2kW-MONO-400W-Project-in-New-Caledonia-2-1024x576.jpg " width="620px" 
    <p>
      Solar energy is the energy harnessed from the sun's radiation. It can be converted into various forms of useful energy, primarily electricity and heat, using technology such as photovoltaic cells and solar thermal systems. Here are some examples of solar energy applications:

       Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Panels: Photovoltaic cells, commonly known as solar panels, convert sunlight directly into electricity. These panels are used on rooftops, in solar farms, and in a variety of applications to generate electricity for homes, businesses, and the grid.
     
       
       solar Water Heaters: Solar thermal systems use sunlight to heat water for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes. These systems are common for heating swimming pools, providing hot water in households, and even supporting central heating in some cases.
       
       Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): Concentrated solar power systems focus sunlight to generate high-temperature heat, which can be used for electricity production. This technology is often employed in large-scale power plants
       
       Solar-Powered Gadgets: Solar cells are used in small-scale applications to power various gadgets, such as solar calculators, outdoor lights, and mobile phone chargers.
       
       Solar Cooking: Solar cookers and ovens use sunlight to cook or heat food, often used in regions where access to traditional cooking fuels is limited.
       
       Solar-Powered Vehicles: Solar energy can be used to charge the batteries of electric vehicles or directly power solar cars designed for racing or transportation.
       
       Solar Desalination: Solar energy can be used to power desalination processes, converting seawater into fresh water in regions with water scarcity.
       
       Solar energy is a clean and sustainable source of power that plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing a renewable alternative to conventional energy sources.</p>

       <h1><i>Hydro Energy</i></h1>
       <img src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/t_edhub_resource_key_image/v1638891998/EducationHub/photos/slovenian-hydroelectric-dam.jpg"width ="620px" 
       <p>Hydropower, also known as hydroelectric power or hydro energy, is a form of renewable energy that harnesses the energy of flowing or falling water to generate electricity. It is one of the oldest and most widely used sources of renewable energy. Here's how hydro energy works:

         Water Source: Hydropower relies on a consistent and reliable source of water, such as a river, dam, or waterfall. The water source should have sufficient flow and elevation change (head) to generate power effectively.
     
         Dam or Diversion Structure: In many cases, a dam or diversion structure is constructed to impound water, creating a reservoir. The dam controls the release of water to regulate the flow through turbines, which is essential for electricity generation.
     
       Turbines: The flow of water is directed through turbines, which are large mechanical devices with blades. As water flows through the turbines, it causes them to spin.
     
        Generator: The spinning turbines are connected to generators. The mechanical energy from the turbines is converted into electrical energy by the generators. This electrical energy is then sent to the power grid for distribution.
     
       Grid Integration: The electricity generated from the hydropower plant is integrated into the electrical grid and distributed to homes, businesses, and industries for various uses.
     
       There are several types of hydropower systems, including:
     
        Run-of-River: In run-of-river hydropower, no dam or reservoir is used. Instead, the system relies on the natural flow of the river. This type of hydropower has a lower environmental impact but may be less reliable in areas with seasonal variations in water flow.
     
        Reservoir: Reservoir-based hydropower systems involve the construction of dams to create artificial lakes or reservoirs. These systems offer more control over water flow and can store energy for use during peak demand periods.
     
       Pumped Storage: Pumped storage hydropower plants involve two reservoirs at different elevations. During periods of excess electricity supply, water is pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. When electricity demand is high, water is released from the upper reservoir through turbines to generate electricity.
     
       Hydropower has several advantages, including its reliability, low greenhouse gas emissions, and ability to store energy. However, it also poses environmental challenges, such as impacts on aquatic ecosystems, disruption of natural river flows, and the displacement of communities when large dams are built. Many efforts are made to mitigate these environmental concerns and make hydropower more sustainable.</p>
     
         <h1><i>BioEnergy</i></h1>
         <img src="https://powerzone.clarkpublicutilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CPUD22_Biomass-Cycle-1-scaled.jpg"width="620px"
         <p>Bioenergy is a form of renewable energy derived from biological sources, typically organic materials such as plants and plant-derived materials. It is a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source because it comes from renewable resources and can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. There are several forms of bioenergy, including:
 
 Biomass: Biomass energy is derived from organic materials like wood, crop residues, agricultural waste, and dedicated energy crops. These materials can be burned directly for heat and electricity or processed into biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel.
 
 Biogas: Biogas is produced through the anaerobic digestion of organic materials like animal manure, food waste, and sewage. It primarily consists of methane and carbon dioxide and can be used for heating, electricity generation, and as a vehicle fuel.
 
 Biofuels: Biofuels are liquid or gaseous fuels made from biological sources. The two most common types are bioethanol, typically produced from crops like corn and sugarcane, and biodiesel, usually made from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biofuels can be used as a substitute for gasoline and diesel fuel in vehicles.
 
 Bioenergy in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Systems: Biomass can be used in combined heat and power (CHP) systems to simultaneously generate heat and electricity. This is a highly efficient way to utilize bioenergy, as the waste heat produced during electricity generation is used for heating purposes.
 
 Algal Biofuels: Some research is focused on using algae to produce biofuels. Algae can be cultivated in ponds or bioreactors and converted into biofuels like biodiesel and bioethanol.
 
 Bioenergy has the advantage of being a carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative energy source because the carbon dioxide released during its use is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants during growth. However, there are also challenges and concerns associated with bioenergy, such as land use competition with food crops, potential environmental impacts, and the need for sustainable sourcing and management of biomass resources. To be environmentally and socially responsible, bioenergy projects need to be well-planned and managed to minimize negative effects while maximizing their renewable energy benefits

   <h1><i>Wind Energy</i></h1>
   <img src="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/huge_16x9_50/public/media-uploads/01_istock_000074694671_large.jpg.webp?h=c3635fa2&itok=h_UzFtqs" width="620px"
  <p>Wind energy is power generated by harnessing the kinetic energy of moving air or wind. It is converted into electricity using wind turbines. Here are some examples of wind energy applications:

Onshore Wind Farms: These are wind energy facilities located on land, typically in open, windy areas. Onshore wind farms consist of multiple wind turbines grouped together to generate electricity for nearby communities and the grid.

Offshore Wind Farms: Offshore wind energy projects are located in bodies of water, usually in coastal regions. Offshore wind turbines are often larger and can take advantage of strong and consistent winds. They generate electricity for coastal communities and are less visually intrusive compared to onshore wind farms.

Distributed Wind Energy: Smaller-scale wind turbines can be installed on individual homes, farms, or businesses to generate on-site electricity or supplement grid power.

Wind-Powered Water Pumping: Wind turbines can be used to pump water for irrigation, livestock, or community water supplies in remote areas where grid power is unavailable.

Wind-Integrated Energy Storage: Wind energy can be integrated with energy storage systems, such as batteries, to store excess electricity when the wind is strong and release it when wind speeds are lower.

Hybrid Systems: Wind power can be combined with other renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, to create hybrid energy systems that provide a more consistent and reliable energy supply.

Microgrids: Wind turbines can be part of microgrid systems that provide localized, reliable power to specific communities or facilities, especially in areas prone to power outages.

Wind Energy for Water Desalination: In some regions, wind energy is used to power desalination processes, converting seawater into fresh water for drinking and irrigation.

Wind energy is a clean and renewable source of electricity that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. It has become an increasingly important component of global efforts to combat climate change and transition to greener energy sources.</p></p>
    <h1>Impact done by non-renewable resources</h1>
    <section id="section3"></section>
    <p><h1><i>What are non renewable resources?</i></h1>
      <p>Non-renewable energy is energy sources that exist in finite quantities and cannot be naturally replenished or regenerated. These energy resources are formed through natural processes, such as the decomposition of organic matter or the nuclear reactions occurring in the Earth’s core. Non-renewable energy plays a significant role in meeting our current energy demands but poses challenges due to its finite nature and environmental impact.

        Non-renewable energy has been the backbone of modern industrialization and has fueled economic growth for centuries. However, the finite nature of these resources calls for the exploration and development of sustainable alternatives, such as renewable energy sources like solar and wind.</p>
      
        <h1><i>Earth Mineral and Metal Ores</i></h1>
        <img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/vvoennyy/vvoennyy1609/vvoennyy160900195/62950173-various-raw-minerals-and-ores-with-names-isolated-on-white-background.jpg"width="620px" height="350px"
        <p>Earth minerals and metal ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth's crust, and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by natural geological processes (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) enough to become economically viable to extract. These processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years, through plate tectonics, tectonic subsidence and crustal recycling.

          The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain rare earth minerals and elements that are more scarce and exhaustible than others. These are in high demand in manufacturing, particularly for the electronics industry.</p>
          <h1><i>Fossil Fuels</i></h1>
          <img src="https://site-547756.mozfiles.com/files/547756/medium/pollution_industry-1827884-1.jpg" width="620px"
          <p>Natural resources such as coal, petroleum(crude oil) and natural gas take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power, see renewable energy.

            An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms, if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor, which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined.These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable, although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.
            
            At present, the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable fossil fuels. Since the dawn of internal combustion engine technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand. As a result, conventional infrastructure and transport systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe.
            
            The modern-day fossil fuel economy is widely criticized for its lack of renewability, as well as being a contributor to climate change.</p>
            <h1><i>Nuclear Fuel</i></h1>
            <img src="https://youmatter.world/app/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/nuclear-energy-ecological-sustainable.jpg"width="620px"
            <p>In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) classified fission reactors that produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume (i.e. breeder reactors) among conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar and falling water.The American Petroleum Institute likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but rather that breeder reactor nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, noting that radioactive waste from used spent fuel rods remains radioactive and so has to be very carefully stored for several hundred years With the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as geothermal energy.

              The use of nuclear technology relying on fission requires Naturally occurring radioactive material as fuel. Uranium, the most common fission fuel, is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and mined in 19 countries.This mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with fissionable uranium-235 which generates heat that is ultimately used to power turbines to generate electricity.
              
              As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in pilot programs and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium leached from the ocean floor, maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level.In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, a paper in the journal of Marine Science & Engineering suggests that with, light water reactors as its target, the process would be economically competitive if implemented on a large scale.
              
              Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world's energy and 13–14% of the world's electricity. Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous radioactive contamination as it relies upon unstable elements. In particular, nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of low and intermediate level waste (LILW) and 10,000 metric tons of high level waste (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.
              
              Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel, relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained, is highly hazardous to people and wildlife. The United Nations (UNSCEAR) estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 millisievert (mSv) from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the Chernobyl disaster and the nuclear fuel cycle, along with 2.0 mSv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 mSv from cosmic rays; all exposures vary by location. Natural uranium in some inefficient reactor nuclear fuel cycles becomes part of the nuclear waste "once through" stream, and in a similar manner to the scenario were this uranium remained naturally in the ground, this uranium emits various forms of radiation in a decay chain that has a half-life of about 4.5 billion years,the storage of this unused uranium and the accompanying fission reaction products have raised public concerns about risks of leaks and containment, however the knowledge gained from studying the natural nuclear fission reactor in Oklo Gabon, has informed geologists on the proven processes that kept the waste from this 2 billion year old natural nuclear reactor that operated for hundreds of thousands of years.</p></p>
    <h1>Future in Renewable Energy</h1>
    <section id="section4"></section>
    <p>Renewable energy resources make up 26% of the world’s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown in 2019, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns.

      Renewable energy in the future is predicted that by 2024, solar capacity in the world will grow by 600 gigawatts (GW), almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is predicted to grow by 1 200 GW by 2024, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US. </p>
      <h1><i>1. Solar Will Become 35% Cheaper By 2024</i></h1>

       <p> When the sun shines onto a solar panel, energy from the sunlight is absorbed by the PV cells in the panel. This energy creates electrical charges that move in response to an internal electrical field in the cell, causing electricity to flow.
        
        Industry experts predict that the US will double its solar installations to four million by 2023. In 2018, the UK had over one million solar panel installations, up by 2% from the previous year and Australia reached two million solar installations in the same year. A big reason for this increased uptake is the fall in prices to install the panels.
        
        The cost of solar PV-based power declined by 13% in 2018, while Carbon Tracker predicts that 72% of coal-based power will become globally unprofitable by 2040. The IEA report found that solar energy will account for 60% of the predicted renewable growth, primarily due to its accessibility. Compared with the previous six-year period, expansion of solar energy has more than doubled. The cost of solar power is expected to decline by 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade.</p>
      <h1><i>2. Future Capacitance of Solar Energy</i></h1>
      <p>Wind and hydropower often require users to live in specific locations, but solar offers more freedom; the sun rises and sets on a predictable schedule, and it’s not as variable as running water or wind. Residential solar power is expected to expand from 58 GW in 2018 to 142 GW by 2024, and annual capacity additions are expected to more than triple to over 20 GW by 2024. China is expected to register the largest installed residential solar capacity in the world by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria.

        Solar facilities will continue reducing their variability rates by storing electricity during the day and running at night. However, advanced solar plants will operate on higher DC to AC ratios, meaning they’ll deliver more consistent service for longer durations.
        
        Commercial and residential buildings will keep running at full capacity even in periods of low sunlight. Closing the gaps between sunlight collection and electricity generation will spur residents and corporations to join the solar movement. Therefore, it’s imperative for governments to implement incentive and remuneration schemes, as well as effective regulation policies. For example, California has mandated that after 2020, solar panels must be installed on new homes and buildings of up to three storeys.
        
        Commercial and industrial solar energy capacity is forecast to constitute 377 GW in 2024, up from 150 GW in 2018, with China predicted to be the largest growth market. This market remains the largest growth segment because solar power is usually more inexpensive and has a relatively stable load profile during the day, which generally enables larger savings on electricity bills.</p>
        <h1><i>3. On shore Wind capacity Will increase by 57% by 2024</i></h1>
        <p>To generate electricity using wind, wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor, which spins a generator, which creates electricity.

          The adoption of wind power is becoming more prominent due to increased capacity.
          
          Onshore wind capacity is expected to expand by 57% to 850 GW by 2024. Annual onshore wind additions will be led by the US and China, owing to a development rush and a policy transition to competitive auctions respectively. Expansion will accelerate in the EU as competitive auctions continue to keep costs relatively low. These auctions will mean that growth in Latin America, the MENA region, Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa will remain stable over the forecast period. 
          
          Offshore wind capacity is forecast to increase almost threefold to 65 GW by 2024, representing almost 10% of total world wind generation. While the EU accounts for half of global offshore wind capacity expansion over the forecast period, on a country basis, China leads deployment, with 12.5 GW in development. The first large US capacity additions are also expected during the forecast period. 
          
          <h1><i>4.Japan Expands Wind Energy</i></h1>
          Japan is experimenting with the idea of installing offshore turbines to replace many of their nuclear reactors, a result of the country’s 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima. The company Marubeni recently signed a project agreement to build offshore farms in northern Japan, with each farm able to produce 140 MW of power.
          
          Japanese lawmakers have created regulations to give developers more certainty in constructing sources of wind-based electricity; legislation outlining competitive bidding processes has been passed to ensure that building costs are reduced and developers consider potential capacity issues. The country’s Port and Harbour Law has also been revised to spur wind turbine construction in port-associated areas and other locations favourable to wind turbines. 
          
          Grid integration, financing and social acceptance remain the key challenges to faster wind expansion globally. </p>
          <h1><i>5. Hydro Electric Capacity will rise 10% by 2024</i></h1>
          <p>
            Hydropower plants capture the energy of falling water to generate electricity. A turbine converts the kinetic energy of falling water into mechanical energy. Then a generator converts the mechanical energy from the turbine into electrical energy.
            
            According to the IEA, hydropower will remain the world’s primary source of renewable power in 2024. Capacity is set to increase 9% (121 GW) over the forecast period, led by China, India and Brazil. 25% of global growth is expected to come from just three megaprojects: two in China (the 16 GW Wudongde and 10 GW Baihetan projects) and one in Ethiopia (the 6.2 GW Grand Renaissance project).
            
            However, there has been a slowdown in the two largest markets, China and Brazil; growth is challenged by rising investment costs due to limited remaining economical sites and extra expenditures in addressing social and environmental impacts.
            
            Nevertheless, annual additions are expected to expand in sub-Saharan Africa and in the ASEAN region as untapped potential is used to meet rising power demand. 
            
            <h1><i>6. Geothermal Capacity Will Increase 28% By 2024</i></h1>
            To generate geothermal energy, hot water is pumped from deep underground through a well under high pressure. When the water reaches the surface, the pressure is dropped, which causes the water to turn into steam. The steam spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. The steam cools off in a cooling tower and condenses back to water. The cooled water is pumped back into the Earth to begin the process again.
            
            The US market for geothermal heat pumps will exceed $2 billion by 2024 as demand for efficient heating solutions increases. Transformed building codes will encourage a move to renewable heating and electricity systems in commercial and residential real estates. 
            
            Geothermal capacity is anticipated to grow 28%, reaching 18 GW by 2024, with Asia responsible for one-third of global expansion, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, followed by Kenya, whose geothermal capacity is set to overtake Iceland’s during the forecast period. 
            
            The same research from Global Market Insights predicts the commercial market will experience the most considerable uptick; according to the Department of Energy, geothermal solutions will generate 8.5% of all electricity in the US by 2050.</p></h2>
